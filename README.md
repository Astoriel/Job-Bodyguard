## 🎩 Overview
**Job Bodyguard** is a next-generation intelligence-gathering Chrome Extension designed to watch your back in the treacherous world of job hunting. Guided by the stealthy aesthetics of the Team Fortress 2 Spy, this tool tracks, analyzes, and guards your job applications from the shadows—detecting red flags, checking salary gaps, and running deep AI analysis on every vacancy you visit.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🕵️‍♂️ Intelligence Extraction (Parsers)
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Seamlessly pulls details, company stats, and locations from top networks like *LinkedIn*, *Indeed*, and *HH*.
- **Ghost Detection**: Automatically highlights missing data—is the salary hidden? Are they asking for 10 years of experience in a 2-year-old framework?

### 🔬 AI-Powered Interrogation
- **Gap Analysis**: Cross-references your personal intel (resume) with the target's demands (job description) to highlight missing skills.
- **Red Flag Sniffer**: Detects suspicious corporate phrasing cleverly disguised as "fast-paced environments."
- **Verdict System**: Gets a quick `Strong Apply`, `Apply`, `Caution`, or `Skip` ruling from your loyal agent.

### 🎭 Stealthy & Stylish Dashboard UI
- **Spy Aesthetic**: Fully customized dark-mode, high-contrast menus built with bespoke **SpyIcons** and **TF2 typography**.
- **Intuitive Status Tracking**: Sort targets into folders—`Saved`, `Applied`, `Interview`, `Offer`, or `Rejected` directly from the UI dropdowns.
- **Tactical Floating Banner**: Sits quietly on career pages, allowing you to run 1-click reconnaissance without alerting the enemy.

### 💼 Secure Intel
- **One-Click Export**: Extracts all your gathered intelligence securely via JSON format directly from your Dashboard.
- **Persistent Storage**: Syncs your hitlist locally and directly via Chrome Storage.
